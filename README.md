Ajaxplorer for Filelink
=======================

Description
-----------
*AjaXplorer for Filelink* allows you to easily send file attachments by
uploading them to an storage service that uses
[Ajaxplorer](http://ajaxplorer.info/) as file management system.
Then, a public link to the file will be inserted into the body of the email.

The extension creates a folder called 'Thunderbird' in your default repository
where files will be uploaded. You can optionally limit the size of this folder
while configuring the AjaXplorer account.

If your AjaXplorer account is linked to one of the mail accounts configured in
Thunderbird, you can fastly configure the extension by selecting it in the
configuration settings. This way, if you change your password in Thunderbird,
*AjaXplorer for Filelink* will automatically use the new one before asking
for a new password.

Requirements
------------
*Ajaxplorer for Filelink* works with Thunderbird 13.* or newer. The lastest
Thunderbird version can be found [here](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/).
